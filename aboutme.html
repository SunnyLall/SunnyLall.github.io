    <p><h2> Welcome to my About Me Page! </h2></p> <br>
  <p> My name is Suneal Singh Lall, but my friends call me Sunny. I was born in San Jose, California, moved to Ann Arbor, Michigan for Kindergarden, then finally settled in East Lyme, Connectucut. I chose URI in hope to join the programing community and leave here with a degree that will allow me to obtain a job that will support me and hopefully a family through life. </p>
